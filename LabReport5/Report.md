# Lab Report 5: Debugging & Reflection
## Part 1: Debugging Scenario
1. Student Post:
  * What environment are you using with screenshot and description of symptom (computer, os, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?
  * Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead
  * detail the failure-inducing input and context (this can mean any or all commands, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran)
2. A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try
3. Another screenshot/terminal output showing what information the student got from trying that, and a clear description of what the bug is
4. At the end, all the info needed about the setup including:
  * The file n directory strcuture needed
  * the contents of each file before fixing the bug
  * the full command line or lines you ran to trigger the bug
  * a description of what to edit to fix the bug
## Part 2: Reflection
In the second half of the quarter, something that I learned from my lab experience that I didn't know before was how the output and the error output from files and commands could be redirected and used through bash script. I found this to be particularly interesting in week6s lab where we were able to learn a little about how graders can use bash script to grade coding submissions. After learning about this, I am interested in how more combinations ofcommands, bash script, code, and files can work and interact with each other. 
Another one of the most useful things that I have learned in this second half of the quarter is the use of shortcuts, whether it is the ssh key to quickly remotely access a server or the command and vim shortcuts, I found these to be very useful in working in the command line.
